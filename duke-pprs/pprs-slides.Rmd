.panel[.panel-name[Objectives]

Consider the following quesions about a network you may be interested in studying:
- What is the boundary of this network? 
- What relations within this network might be of interest to your research? 
- What attributes about actors in this network might you want to 
- How might you collect data about these actors and their relations? 

Record your response in the chat.

Breakout rooms used for affinity groups for research topic areas.

Scholars were also encouraged to engage one another and the project team using the Slack collaboration platform.]

# Lessons Learned from Summer 2021

- Participants found that the keynotes and presentations particularly impactful to their understanding of LA methodologies.

- Expressed a desire for more practice with topic areas (e.g., machine learning or text mining) or greater exposure to fewer focus areas.

- Highlighted a need for access to resources such as articles, videos, and/or real research projects.

- Scaffolding according to experience with R

- Coding in the cloud had its challenges!

# Virtual Residue

What elements from our virtual year are worth retaining? 
- [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) despite it's many bugs
- The flexibility and differentiation virtual compelled us to accommodate. 
- [Virtual Case studies](https://laser-institute.github.io/text-mining/keys/tm-learning-lab-2-key.html), though for badging and accountability. 
- Expanding curation and development of online resources.  
- To Slack or not to Slack? That really is a question mark. 


---
# Community Participate(ion)
What elements from our virtual year need better attention? 
- More opportunities for personal and professional networking
- Setting community norms and expectations for participation
- More structured activities for supporting professional collaboration

We've contracted with [Participate, Inc.](https://www.participate.com) to help us develop in-person community-building activities for summer workshop and  activities during the academic year for the Online Community of Practice. 

---
# Summer Workshop Changes
So what changes are we making for the coming year?
- Virtual only as a last resort 
- 1 week, definitely not 2
- More Content but Less Content 
- Badging & Accountability
- Better Balance among Program Goals  

[Summer Schedule and Topics for 2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145nCvK2f_I_25qNq7hx-89KChxDbvzVImIxXFAi0Bk4/edit#heading=h.61b4ys86pca0)
