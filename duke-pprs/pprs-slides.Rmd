.panel[.panel-name[Disciplinary Knowledge]


.pull-left[
## All Aboard

<img src="img/lines.png" height="300px"/>

.pull-right[
## Digging Deeper
*“...it would have been helpful to have to select one ‘track’ so we could have **opportunities to really deepen our understanding of one method** and get some additional hands-on time with it.”*
]

]


.panel[.panel-name[Tech(nical) Skills]


.pull-left[
## impRoved proficiency
- *"**I understand R more closely now** and the myriad functions and features that can be used to wrangle, clean, and visualize data."*

- *“**The labs were critical** in developing my proficiency, particularly with the guidance of an instructor present."*

## A Good Start 
*“Just by **working with others in the labs and having discussions in the affinity groups was very helpful.** I've gained some LinkedIn and Twitter connections and have looked forward to that."*

]


.pull-right[
## Sustaining Connections
*“I think regular check-ins and additional workshops throughout the year will be very helpful... **organize meetups or invite scholars to virtual events** over the next year and collaboration will continue to grow stronger.”

# Diving Deeper

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Learning Labs]
Each Content Area (e.g. Data Viz, Text Mining, Machine Learning) will consist of four progressively sequenced Learning Labs that include: 
- **Intro Workshop** to summarize core concepts and practice key R skills
- **Essential reading(s)** and discussions that unpack core concepts
- **Guided practice** with key R skills consisting of a [Case Study](https://laser-institute.github.io/aera-workshop/pages/text-mining-demo.html) (ML, TM, and SNA) or [tutorial](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) (FLA, VIZ)
- **Independent analysis** that applies the concepts/skills to a dataset provided or their own 
- A **badge/microcredential** that demonstrates their competency


]


.panel[.panel-name[Guest Speakers]

Our Guest Speaker series will feature authors of the recently updated [Handbook of Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/publications/hla-22/) presented by their author(s) presenting topics such as: 
- What is learning analytics?
- Learning Analytics for Understanding and Supporting Collaboration
- Data Literacy and Learning Analytics
- Learning Analytics and Learning at Scale
- Fairness, Absence of Bias, and Equity in Learning Analytics

]



.panel[.panel-name[Community Building]

We've partnered with [Participate, Inc.](https://www.participate.com) to help us: 
- develop in-person and online **community-building activities**
- organize **affinity groups** for collaborative research 
- structure monthly **progress updates** with scholars
- facilitate online **discussions forums**
